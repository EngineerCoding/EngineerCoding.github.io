My website host Github Pages, which attempts to be both informational and geeky at the same time. The primary goal of this website is to increase my web design skills, which are not my best cup of tea to be quite honest.


The stack is a very, very simple stack:

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript: both frameworkless and primarily as enhancement!


If you are interested to make a PR, feel free to do so! However you want to make a big change in the design, please first discuss before you spend any time on it: it would be a shame if you put in a lot of work and it doesn't get merged because I personally don't like it.
